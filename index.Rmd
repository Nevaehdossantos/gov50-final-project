## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to race and the relationship with voting turnout. How likely is each race to vote and what can those reasons be. Voter suppression can influence this so I want to talk about voting suppression somehow. I can also mention which party each race is likely to vote for. (this idea might change but this is my first idea)
